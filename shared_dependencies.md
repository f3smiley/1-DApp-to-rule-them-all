Shared Dependencies:

1. **Ethereum and Polygon Networks**: Both networks are used across multiple files, including the smart contracts and the frontend files.

2. **ERC20 Token Standard**: The LockableToken and MintableToken smart contracts both implement the ERC20 token standard.

3. **User Wallet Addresses**: User Ethereum wallet addresses are used in the frontend for user authentication and in the smart contracts for token management.

4. **Token Balances**: The user's token balance is used in the frontend for token management and in the smart contracts for locking and minting tokens.

5. **Chainlink Oracles**: The Chainlink oracles are used in the frontend for data display, in the smart contracts for determining the exchange rate, and in the oracle contracts.

6. **Exchange Rate**: The current exchange rate between the LockableToken and the MintableToken is used in the frontend, the smart contracts, and the oracle contracts.

7. **Transaction Data**: Transaction data is used in the frontend for transaction management and in the smart contracts for locking and minting tokens.

8. **DOM Element IDs**: The frontend files will likely share DOM element IDs for user interaction, such as "walletConnectButton", "lockTokenButton", "mintTokenButton", "unlockTokenButton", "currentBalanceDisplay", and "currentExchangeRateDisplay".

9. **Function Names**: Function names like "connectWallet", "lockTokens", "mintTokens", "unlockTokens", "getBalance", and "getExchangeRate" will likely be used across multiple frontend files.

10. **Message Names**: Message names for user notifications, such as "walletConnected", "tokensLocked", "tokensMinted", "tokensUnlocked", "transactionSent", and "transactionConfirmed" will likely be used across multiple frontend files.

11. **Smart Contract Addresses**: The addresses of the deployed smart contracts will be used in the frontend files and in the Chainbridge file for cross-chain communication.

12. **Chainlink Node Addresses**: The addresses of the Chainlink nodes will be used in the oracle contracts and in the Chainlink nodes file.

13. **Hyperledger BISU Node Addresses**: The addresses of the Hyperledger BISU nodes will be used in the smart contracts and in the Hyperledger BISU nodes file.

14. **Security Audit and Testing Functions**: Functions for security auditing and testing, such as "runTests" and "runSecurityAudit", will be used in the testing and security files.

4. **Contract ABIs**: Used in the scripts and frontend components to interact with the smart contracts.

5. **Contract Addresses**: Used in the scripts and frontend components to locate the smart contracts on the blockchain.

6. **Function Names**: Functions like `lockTokens`, `mintSyntheticTokens`, `getBalance`, `getPrice`, etc. are used across multiple files.

7. **DOM Element IDs**: IDs like `lockTokensButton`, `mintTokensButton`, `tokenBalanceDisplay`, etc. are used in the frontend components.

8. **Message Names**: Messages like `TokensLocked`, `TokensMinted`, `BalanceFetched`, `PriceFetched`, etc. are used in the smart contracts, scripts, and frontend components.

9. **NPM Packages**: Packages like `axios`, `ethers`, and `react` are used across multiple files.

10. **Error Messages**: Standardized error messages are used in the smart contracts, scripts, and frontend components for error handling.

11. **Chainlink Node Addresses**: Used in the smart contracts and the Chainlink node script to fetch price data.

12. **Deployment Script**: The deployment script uses the contract files, the contract ABIs, and the contract addresses.

13. **Security and Optimization Functions**: Functions for error handling, access control, and efficiency optimization are used across multiple files.
